# Optimization_Techniques
Performing L1 and L2 Regularization techniques to make the R-square value optimized.
The project sheds light on the importance of L1 and L2 regularization in mitigating overfitting. Analyze the results to understand how different hyperparameter settings and regularization strengths affect the model's generalization performance.

Feel free to reach out for any questions or further collaboration.
